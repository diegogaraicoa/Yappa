The trajectory documents an extensive, iterative UI/UX overhaul of a React Native/Expo application named YAPPA, followed by the creation of a new marketing landing page. The process was highly collaborative, driven by continuous user feedback in Spanish.

Initially, the work involved a screen-by-screen redesign from a green fintech theme to a more refined aesthetic, including Home, Auth, forms (Sales, Expenses), and list pages (Debts, Customers, Suppliers). This phase included significant UX enhancements requested by the user, such as adding inline creation of customers/products from forms and implementing full edit functionality for customers and suppliers. Numerous small UI consistency fixes were made, such as standardizing header content and logo sizes.

The project then pivoted based on a new user request. A final logo and color palette (cyan  and dark blue ) were provided. This led to a global re-branding of the mobile app, replacing the primary green color with cyan.

The final and current task is the creation and deployment of a separate marketing landing page. A new Next.js project () was scaffolded with multiple components and API routes. The immediate work involves pushing this new project to the user's GitHub repository to enable deployment via Vercel. The user's primary language is Spanish, and future interactions should be in Spanish.

The project consists of two main parts:

1.  **Mobile App UI/UX Overhaul:** The primary goal was to completely redesign the YAPPA React Native/Expo application. This involved transforming its appearance to a modern, minimalist fintech style. The process was iterative and covered nearly all screens, including authentication, home dashboard, forms (sales, expenses), and data management lists (debts, customers, suppliers, etc.). Key functional requirements added during the redesign include inline creation of entities (e.g., creating a customer from the sale form), full CRUD functionality on list screens, and data-driven dashboards. The final stage involved a full re-branding, changing the primary color scheme from green to a new cyan/dark blue palette based on a new logo.

2.  **Marketing Landing Page:** A new requirement was to build a separate, public-facing website for YAPPA. This landing page, built with Next.js, must be minimalist, modern, and reflect the app's branding. It needs to include sections for product benefits, the company's mission, contact information, a demo request form, and a sign-up form for new stores. The website must be deployable on Vercel for public access.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Mobile App:**
    - React Native with Expo
    -  for file-based navigation
    -  for styling, state management with /
    -  for REST API communication
- **Landing Page:**
    - Next.js framework
    - React components for UI structure
    - Git for version control
    - Vercel for deployment
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The codebase is split into two distinct projects within the  directory: the React Native mobile application () and the new Next.js landing page ().



-   ****: These files constitute the React Native mobile app. Nearly all have been rewritten or heavily edited to align with the YAPPA design system, implement new features (like edit modals), and finally update the color scheme from green to cyan (). Key files like , , and  were rewritten multiple times to accommodate user feedback.

-   ****: This Expo configuration file was modified to update the  screen and  background colors to match the new dark blue () from the final logo.

-   ****: This is a brand new directory containing a standard Next.js project. It was created from scratch to build the marketing website.
    -   ****: The main entry point for the landing page, which composes all the different sections.
    -   ****: Individual React components for each section of the landing page (Hero, Benefits, Contact, etc.).
    -   ****: A markdown file created to guide the user through the Vercel deployment process.
    -   ****: A Git repository was initialized in this directory to prepare for pushing the code to GitHub.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the push of the  project to the user's GitHub repository.
- Guide the user to connect the GitHub repository to their Vercel account to finalize the landing page deployment.
- Redesign the Admin Console () screen in the mobile app, which was explicitly postponed by the user.
- Update the mobile app's icon and splash screen assets using the final logo image provided by the user.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate task is deploying the newly created **YAPPA landing page**. The work has progressed to the final step before the user can deploy it on Vercel.

A new Next.js project was created in the  directory, and all the necessary components, pages, and API routes for the landing page have been scaffolded.

To facilitate deployment, a Git repository was initialized within the  directory. Following the user's request, the AI is in the process of pushing this local repository to a remote repository on the user's GitHub account ().

The very last action taken was executing . The next logical step is to push the  branch to this newly added remote origin, which will make the code available on GitHub for Vercel to access.

<optional_next_step>
Execute the  command to upload the landing page code to the user's GitHub repository, then guide the user on how to complete the deployment on Vercel.
